// What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?

    // user enters a string of rock paper or scissors

// What’s the desired output?

    // the winner will be determined and outputted in the console after 5 rounds of rock paper scissors

// Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

// getComputerChoice will randomly return either “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”
    
    // use math.random to get a random number between 0 - 1 divided into three parts

// getHumanChoice will prompt the use for a choice and return that choice

// create a humanScore and a computerScore in the global scope set to 0

// create a function playRound with two parameters humanChoice and computerChoice that plays one round

    // make the humanChoice parameter case-insensitive

    // console.log the winner of the match based on having conditionals for all outcomes while also incrementing the human or computer score

// create a function playGame that calls playRound 5 times and move the score variables within the playGame function
